#' Install a Package Temporarily
#' 
#' Installs and loads a package for the current session.
#' The package won't be available in future sessions and will
#' eventually be deleted from the machine with no additional
#' effort needed by the user.  This will also install the necessary
#' dependencies temporarily as well.
#' 
#' @param package The package we want to install temporarily
#' @param character.only logical. Is the input a character string?
